# QtInstrumentCluster

A basic Instrument cluster application that demonstrates integrating QML and C++.
This application is leveraged from [Qt Quick Ultralite Automotive Cluster Demo
](https://doc.qt.io/QtForMCUs-2.5/quickultralite-automotive-example.html)
, but without the use of Qt Quick Ultralite as it is only available under commercial license.

The main focus points are to prove the following skills:
1. Knowledge and hands-on experience in Qt
2. Integrating QML and C++
3. Usage of signals and slots
4. Usage of Singleton classes
5. Simulating data
6. Keyboard event handling
